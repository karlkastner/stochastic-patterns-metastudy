Reproduce analysis, tables and figures of the accompanying manuscript by
running the batch script "pattern_analysis_batch"

Users wanting to apply the method to their own patterns can start with
the script "pattern_analysis_minimum_working_example", after fetching the
dependencies

Software requirements:
	Matlab (tested with version R2023b)

	The repository of the manuscript requires library files stored in further
	repositories of the main author. These dependencies are automatically
	fetched by running the first part of the script "pattern_analysis_batch"

Data requirements:
	Extracted images of patterns from the references included in the meta-
	study. For copyright reasons, theses are not included in this manuscript
